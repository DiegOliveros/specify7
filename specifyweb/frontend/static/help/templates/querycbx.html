  <h1>Query Combo Box</h1>
  <p>
    This is a query combo box. It is used to associate an independent
    resource (<%- relatedModel.getLocalizedName() %>) with the resource
    shown on the current form (<%- thisModel.getLocalizedName() %>).
  </p>
  <p>
    It works by searching for a related resource that has one or more of
    its fields (<%- searchFields %>) that start with the text you have
    entered. Matches are shown in a drop down list from which you can
    select the desired resource.
