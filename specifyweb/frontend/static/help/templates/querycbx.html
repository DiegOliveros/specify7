<div title="Query Combo Box">
  <p>
    This is a query combo box. It is used to associate an independent
    resource, <em><%- relatedModel.getLocalizedName() %></em>, with
    the resource shown on the current
    form, <em><%- thisModel.getLocalizedName() %></em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It works by searching for a related resource that has one or more
    of its field(s) (i.e. <em><%- searchFields %></em>) that start
    with the text you have entered. Matches are shown in a drop down
    list from which you can select the desired resource.
  </p>
